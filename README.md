# Asymmetric Ambiguity Noise

The model aims to study how ambiguity noise affects opinion dynamics in a bounded confidence model, given that individuals communicate with low ambiguity noise across in-groups and with high ambiguity noise between groups. 

The model is coded in netlogo. The data processing to initialise opinions in the agent population is coded in pyhthon.
